# Sudoku-Solver
Using Backtracking algorithmic-technique, we recursively generate a digit from 1 to 9 and test if it can be placed in a particular square. We cross check if the number can be placed there or not. If the number is placed incorrectly, we backtrack or remove the possibility of that particular number being placed in that square by eliminating it.
